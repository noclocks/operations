# Slack

> Slack is a cloud-based set of proprietary team collaboration tools and services, founded by Stewart Butterfield. Slack began as an internal tool used by his company, Tiny Speck, in the development of Glitch, a now defunct online game. The name is an acronym for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge".

## Getting Started

Options for conversations in Slack include:

- Send direct messages to one or more people.
- Create a group direct message with a group of others.
- Create a public channel for ongoing conversations with a specific group of people.
- Create a private channel for conversations with a specific group of people that is not open to everyone in the workspace.

While there are situations for which private communication (via direct messages and private channels) is preferable, default to public channels so that anyone in your organization can find the information they need when searching for it in the future.

Slack ships with two default channels,`#general` and `#random`, so creating new channels is the first step to organizing your work. That said, you don’t have to launch dozens of channels right away. Instead, add channels when there’s a real need.

Those might include:

- **Team Channels:** Channels dedicated to a specific team's conversations and updates (i.e. `team-marketing`).
- **Project Channels:** Channels dedicated to a specific project's conversations and updates (i.e. `proj-website-redesign`).
- **Interest Channels:** Channels dedicated to a specific interest or topic (i.e. `org-merch`).
- **Client Channels:** Channels dedicated to a specific client's conversations and updates (i.e. `client-xyz`).
- **External Tool Channels:** Channels dedicated to a specific tool's conversations and updates (i.e. `tool-slack`).

> Tip: Mark important messages with a star to easily find them later. You can also use the `/remind` command to remind yourself about a message or task at a later time.

## Channels

> Channels are one of Slack’s core features and the best way to organize teams around a common goal.
> Channels create clarity and visibility around roles and responsibilities, which helps work get done faster and more efficiently.
> Keeping track of channels is important. It's easy to lose track of channels and miss important conversations, but maintaining channels doesn't have to be a chore.

Here are some tips for keeping your channels organized:

- Create naming conventions for channels to make them easy to find and understand.
- Use prefixes to group channels together in the sidebar.
- Archive channels that are no longer active.
- Pin important channels to the top of the sidebar.
- Use channel descriptions to provide context and guidelines for the channel.
- Use threads to keep conversations organized and focused.
- Create channels as needed, but avoid creating too many channels.
- Use channel topics to provide context and guidelines for the channel.

### Naming Conventions

Adding logical prefixes to channel names helps keep them organized and clarifies their purpose. It also helps to group channels together in the sidebar.

Channel Prefixes:

- `project-*`: For project-specific channels.
- `team-*`: For team-specific channels.
- `client-*`: For client-specific channels.
- `account-*`: For account-specific channels.
- `org-*`: For organization-wide channels.
- `fun-*`: For fun and social channels.
- `tool-*`: For channels related to specific tools.

Once you've established a naming convention, it's important to communicate it to your team and encourage everyone to follow it.

Pinning the naming convention guidelines across the main announcement channels is a good way to ensure everyone is on the same page.

### Large Projects

For large projects involving multiple topics or teams, consider creating a channel for each topic or team involved in the project. This will help keep conversations organized and focused, and make it easier to find information later.

For example, a large development project may have dedicated channels for:

- `proj-website`: Main project channel.
- `dev-website`: Development team channel where developers share and review code and conduct tests and reviews.
- `design-website`: Design team channel where designers share and review designs and conduct tests and reviews.
- `feedback-website`: Feedback channel where stakeholders and users can provide feedback on the project.
- `mktng-website`: Marketing team channel where marketing team members can discuss the marketing strategy for the project.


### Organize Channels into Sections

> A nice Slack feature is "sections" allowing users to further organize channels. Create your own sections to group your channels, direct messages, and apps, with the most important conversations at the top.

The first section created should be dedicated to the most vital work, and from there, further customization can be made to suit your team's needs.
