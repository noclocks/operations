# Python Installation

> This page is a guide to installing Python on your computer.

## Contents

## Overview

- Utilize [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  - Lets you change the global Python version on a per-user basis.
  - Provides support for per-project Python versions.
  - Allows you to override the Python version with an environment variable.
  - Searches for commands from multiple versions of Python at a time. This may be helpful to test across Python versions with tox.
