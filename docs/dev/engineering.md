# Engineering Fundamentals

## Source Control

-   [ ] The default target branch is locked.
-   [ ] Merges are done through PRs.
-   [ ] PRs reference related work items.
-   [ ] Commit history is consistent and commit messages are informative (what, why).
-   [ ] Consistent branch naming conventions.
-   [ ] Clear documentation of repository structure.
-   [ ]  Secrets are not part of the commit history or made public. (see [Credential scanning](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/continuous-integration/dev-sec-ops/secret-management/credential_scanning/))
-   [ ] Public repositories follow the [OSS guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/source-control/#creating-a-new-repository), see `Required files in default branch for public repositories`.
