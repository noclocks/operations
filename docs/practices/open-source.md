>   The open source way is a set of principles derived from open [source software development](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) models and applied more broadly to additional industries and domains. Opensource.com exists to share how the open source way can change our world in the same way the open source model has changed software.

## Principles of Open Source

**Transparency.** Whether we're developing software or solving a business problem, we all have access to the information and materials necessary for doing our best work. And when these materials are accessible, we can build upon each other's ideas and discoveries. We can make more effective decisions and understand how decisions affect us.

**Collaboration.** When we're free to participate, we can enhance each other's work in unanticipated ways. When we can modify what others have shared, we unlock new possibilities. By initiating new projects together, we can solve problems that no one can solve alone. And when we implement open standards, we enable others to contribute in the future.

**Release early and often.** Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid discoveries. An iterative approach leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and seek answers in new places. You can learn by doing.

**Inclusive meritocracy.** Good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas should win. Only by including diverse perspectives in our conversations can we be certain we've identified the best ideas, and decision-makers continually seek those perspectives. We may not operate by consensus, but successful work determines which projects gather support and effort from the community.

**Community.** Communities form when different people unite around a common purpose. Shared values guide decision making, and community goals supersede individual interests and agendas.
