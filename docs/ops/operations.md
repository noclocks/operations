## Operations

### Low-Burn Culture

-   Save Money & Invest it back into Product
-   Tooling:
    -   Use Free Versions until outgrow
    -   Negotiate contracts for all vendors
-   Burn Rate: 
    -   Revenue - Spend = Burn
-   Runway:
    -   Runway means how many months you can continue to operate before you run out of money at your current pace of spending?
    -   To know your runway, you need to know two things:
        -   how much money you lose every month?
        -   how much cash do you have in the bank?



### Finances

-   Track all expenses
-   Categorize Expenses
-   For every tool:
    -   Assign an owner
    -   Track when free trial expires
    -   Track costs
-   Monthly Profit & Loss + Balance Sheets
    -   The balance sheet reports the assets, liabilities and shareholder equity at a specific point in time
    -   P&L (profit & loss) statement summarizes a company's revenues, costs, and expenses during a specific period of time
    -   Typically these are reviewed every quarter at a minimum
    -   P&L and Balance Sheet together is an instant "snapshot of your business"
    -   Always have these on hand when you're talking with investors
    -   If you type in "P&L template" or "balance sheet template" on Google there are tons of great templates and tools available
    -   Sometimes founders will outsource this work
        -   That is fine but you should review it at least monthly
        -   Check their work diligently
        -   As a founder you need to understand your P&L balance sheets
        -   This can help you forecast any possible scenarios (whether it be growth or going backwards)
-   Curate a Growth Plan
    -   When you want to raise money from investors, you should have a clear growth plan
    -   Basically: map out how you will spend your targeted raise down to the dollar
    -   Growing or Zombie mode
    -   Examples we go through at LAUNCH:
        -   Give three different growth models: 5% MoM, 10% MoM, 20% MoM (best cast, worst case, medium case)
        -   Then, map out how you will hit these numbers based on the data you already have
        -   If you're a SaaS business: how many new salespeople will it take to hit 20% MoM growth?
        -   Or, how many months does it take an average salesperson to pay for themselves?
        -   If you know these numbers, you can model out your growth for years to come
-   Ensure Utilizing **Accrual-Based Accounting** and not **Cash-Based Accounting**
    -   Startups should ALWAYS use accrual-based accounting
        -   Public companies are REQUIRED to use accrual-based accounting, rather than cash-based
        -   Accrual-based is GAAP - or a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle
    -   Will investors avoid your company if you used cash-based accounting?
    -   Essentially, accrual-based accounting is when you record revenues and expenses when they are earned, regardless of when the money is actually received or paid
    -   For SaaS businesses - this means an annual contract is recognized over 12 months, not up front
    -   You need to know when and how your revenue being recognized
