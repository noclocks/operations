# Learn in Public

> **Learning in public** is the idea of sharing your learning journey with the world. It's a way to hold yourself accountable, to learn in a more structured way, and to help others learn from your experiences.

## Overview

In today's fast-paced world, learning new skills is more important than ever. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone who wants to keep up with the latest trends, learning in public can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals.

## Drawbacks of Learning in Private

There's a lot to learn, and you will never be done learning. Typically, the modern knowledge worker will **learn in private** which I believe is a mistake. Learning in private has consequences such as not creating unseen opportunities for yourself, not being able showcase and share your insights as a form of proof of your expertise and knowledge with others, and not being able to get feedback on your learning. The most important thing is what you made of the information you learned, how you curated that information into knowledge to be shared with others, and what novel ideas and solutions came from the research undertaken.

Another common fallacy is that you need to be an expert to share your knowledge. This is not true. You can share what you know, and you can share what you're learning. You can share your successes and your failures. You can share your insights and your questions.

## Benefits of Learning in Public

Learning in public forces a *habit of creation*. It forces you to create something, to share something, to put something out into the world. This can be a blog post, a video, a podcast, a tweet, a GitHub repository, a presentation, a workshop, a course, a book, or anything else that you can share with others. The key is to create something that others can learn from, that others can benefit from, that others can use to improve their own lives or work.

Learning in public also forces a *habit of reflection*. It forces you to reflect on what you've learned, to think about how you've learned it, to consider what you've learned, and to share what you've learned with others. This can be a blog post, a video, a podcast, a tweet, a GitHub repository, a presentation, a workshop, a course, a book, or anything else that you can share with others. The key is to reflect on what you've learned, to think about how you've learned it, to consider what you've learned, and to share what you've learned with others.
