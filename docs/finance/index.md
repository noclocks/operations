# Finance

> As [No Clocks, LLC](https://github.com/noclocks) is a Tech-based Startup, a primary goal for us is to be *lean and agile*
> with regard to our financial operations. We aim to keep our internal systems as robust, flexible, and scalable as possible.

## Overview

With so much information available, it can be difficult to know where to start. This section is designed to provide a
high-level overview of the characteristics of how to keep our financial operations effective, lean, and agile:

- A financial control environment providing cost-effective and time-efficient management of all accounting and finance
  operations and requirements.

- Robust financial reporting provides the bedrock for managing cash requirements, forecasting, and future investment in the company.

- Specialist statutory accounting, payroll, tax, and compliance services ensuring legal compliance and tax efficiency.

- A flexible and scalable financial system that can grow with the company and adapt to the changing needs of the business.

- A finance team that is responsive, proactive, and able to provide the necessary support and advice to the business.

## Financial Management

As our business scales and grows, the importance of effective accounting practices, cash-flow management, and the
deployment of systems and expertise to manage these areas becomes increasingly important.

Effective management of accounting and finance enables entrepreneurs to track income and expenditures, ensure statutory compliance, and provide investors, management, and government with relevant financial information.

Implementing best practices can provide the functionality, scalability and flexibility to support the business as it scales and grows.

As we are still in the early stages of our startup, appointing a full-time finance resource seems unnecessary and financially out of reach.

Instead of getting caught up managing day-to-day accounting and finance tasks in the early stages of growth, we strive for
effective and affordable alternatives for growing our tech business to build a finance function and establish accounting
best practice, leaving the founders the ability to focus on revenue-generating activities.

From the outset, basic accounting and finance tasks, such as:

- Invoice Processing
- Payment Runs
- Preparation of Management Accounts
- Releasing Payments to Suppliers
- Payroll
- Budgeting and Forecasting

should be manageable with an "out of the box" accounting service without hiring a dedicated resource.
