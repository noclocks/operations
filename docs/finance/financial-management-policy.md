## Policy

### 1. Financial Transaction and Bookkeeping Management

1.  **Transaction Recording:**
    -   All financial transactions must be recorded in both QuickBooks **and** Relay immediately upon occurrence. The individual responsible for the transaction must categorize, explain, and detail the transaction as well as upload all relevant documents, receipts, invoices, etc. to both QuickBooks and Relay. 
        -   This includes transactions made from business accounts (Relay, PayPal, Square) and any personal account transactions related to business activities`**`.
    -   Transactions should be categorized consistently in alignment with the chart of accounts.
    

`**`: *In the case of a transaction occurring outside of a tracked business account for business reasons, the transaction should be treated as an expense request and should be *emulated* as if made by the business account. This is done by withdrawing the correct amount from a business account depositing into the personal account, adding necessary memo and note to the withdrawal in Relay, and finally, marking the transaction appropriately in QuickBooks as an expense. 

2.  **Personal Use of Business Accounts:**
    -   Business accounts are to be used solely for business-related expenses. **Exceptions must be documented and approved by both partners.**
        -   The partners must agree upon what is deemed as personal vs. business. If one partner uses the company to pay for cell phone bill and the other does not, this must be accounted for and discussed before hand.
    -   Any personal expenses paid from the business account by a partner must be recorded as an equity draw and adjusted in the partner’s equity account.
3.  **Payroll and Salary Management:**
    -   Salaries or withdrawals must be recorded accurately, with appropriate documentation. Given the unequal equity contributions, any withdrawals by a partner should be classified as either salary or an equity draw and reflected in the financial statements.
    -   No partner may use business accounts for personal expenses without proper documentation and mutual agreement.
4.  **Bookkeeping and Accounting:**
    -   Monthly reconciliation of all accounts must be conducted to ensure accuracy in financial records. This includes comparing QuickBooks entries with bank statements and receipts.
    -   A professional bookkeeper or accountant should review the books quarterly to ensure compliance with accounting standards and tax regulations.

### 2. Partnership Equity Management

1.  **Equity Contributions:**
    -   All equity contributions must be documented and recorded in the partner’s equity account.
    -   Since one partner has made more significant contributions while the other has taken withdrawals, an equity adjustment must be calculated quarterly to ensure fairness in ownership percentages.
2.  **Equity Draws and Adjustments:**
    -   Equity draws should be minimized and documented as withdrawals from the partner’s equity account.
    -   Any adjustments to equity, such as compensating for unequal contributions or withdrawals, should be agreed upon by both partners and recorded in QuickBooks.
3.  **Equity Review:**
    -   Equity accounts should be reviewed quarterly, with adjustments made to reflect any significant differences in contributions or withdrawals.

### 3. Tax Management and Withholding

1.  **Tax Withholding:**
    -   A portion of all revenue should be withheld in a separate tax account to cover estimated taxes.
    -   The amount withheld should be calculated based on projected annual revenue and current tax rates.
2.  **Tax Compliance:**
    -   The company must adhere to all federal, state, and local tax obligations. Quarterly estimated tax payments should be made to avoid penalties.
    -   A tax professional should be engaged annually to review the company’s tax strategy and filings.

### 4. Revenue Recognition and Client Payments

1.  **Tracking Incoming Revenue:**
    -   All client revenue must be tracked from initial quote/proposal through to final payment. This includes maintaining records of quotes, proposals, invoices, contracts, and agreements.
    -   Invoices should be generated through QuickBooks or Stripe and linked to the corresponding client account in the financial system.
2.  **Revenue Allocation:**
    -   Revenue must be allocated in the financial records to reflect where each dollar goes, including operational expenses, taxes, payroll, and equity distributions.
    -   A detailed revenue report should be generated monthly, showing all income, expenses, and the allocation of funds.

### 5. Financial Projections and Planning

1.  **Financial Forecasting:**
    -   Monthly financial projections should be developed based on current revenue, expenses, and historical data. These projections should include expected revenue, operating expenses, tax obligations, and potential equity draws.
    -   Projections should be reviewed by both partners to ensure alignment with business goals and financial stability.
2.  **Budgeting:**
    -   A budget should be established annually, with monthly reviews to compare actual spending against the budget. This will help manage cash flow and identify areas where adjustments may be necessary.
    -   Any significant deviations from the budget should be discussed and addressed by both partners.

### 6. Compliance and Reporting

1.  **Internal Controls:**
    -   Internal controls should be established to prevent unauthorized transactions and ensure accuracy in financial reporting. This includes regular audits and segregation of duties.
    -   All financial reports, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, should be generated monthly and reviewed by both partners.
2.  **Reporting and Documentation:**
    -   Comprehensive financial reports should be prepared monthly, detailing income, expenses, equity changes, and tax obligations. These reports should be accessible to both partners and retained for future reference.
    -   All documentation related to financial transactions, including receipts, contracts, and tax filings, must be maintained and organized for easy retrieval.

### 7. Policy Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed quarterly, or as needed, to ensure it remains current with the company’s operations and financial practices and must be approved/signed-off by both partners.
