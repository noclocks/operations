It's a structured way of managing branches in a repository to streamline the development process, feature integration, releases, and maintenance. The Git Flow model emphasizes the use of separate branches for different purposes, such as new features, releases, and hotfixes, ensuring a clean and organized project history. Below is an explanation of the primary branches and their roles in the Git Flow model, along with a conceptual diagram of how they interact.</p> <p>The primary branches in the Git Flow Model are:</p> <ul> <li><code>main</code>: This branch stores the official release history. It should be stable and deployable at any time.</li> <li><code>develop</code>: Derived from the main branch, this branch serves as an integration branch for features. It's where daily development happens and where feature branches merge back into.</li> </ul> <p>Then there are various \u201csupporting\u201dbranches such as:</p> <ul> <li><code>feature/</code>: Feature branches should branch off from <code>develop</code> and merge back into <code>develop</code>. Each feature branch is dedicated to building a specific feature and is named accordingly (e.g., <code>feature/new-login-page</code>).</li> <li> <p><code>release/</code>: Release branches branch off from <code>develop</code> and merge into both <code>develop</code> and <code>main</code>. These branches are used for preparing a new production release. They allow for minor bug fixes and preparing metadata for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). A release branch is named with the release version number (e.g., <code>release/v1.2.0</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>hotfix/</code>: Hotfix branches branch off from <code>main</code> and merge back into both <code>develop</code> and <code>main</code>.

Lifetime Value (LTV) The total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their lifetime. A high LTV relative to CAC indicates a profitable customer relationship. Churn Rate The rate at which customers stop using a product or service. A high churn rate can impact revenue and growth. Run Rate The annualized revenue based on current performance.
