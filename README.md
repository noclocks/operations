## Introduction

This repository contains the operations documentation for No Clocks, LLC. 

We believe that setting up a well-organized repository structure for our ongoing operations is crucial for startups, especially those in the technology services sector.
A clear and logical structure helps streamline operations, improve collaboration, and ensure consistency across projects.

By organizing our operations with this repository, we can create a centralized hub for all essential operational resources, 
making it easier for our team to access information, collaborate effectively, and maintain consistency in processes and procedures.
